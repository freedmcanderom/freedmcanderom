American Banker reported that at least three large banks were planning to offer small loans, repayable in affordable installments, at prices that were roughly six times lower than those of average payday loans.6 Given the choice, most borrowers say they would use these lower-cost bank or credit union loans rather than payday loans. Financial institutions have stated that they would not be able to offer such loans under the Freedomcashlenders proposed ability-to-repay Freedomcashlenders test but would under the 5 percent payment alternative.
